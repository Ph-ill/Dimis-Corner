Ok now I want to work on a dynamic title design system.

The title text should choose from a group of fonts currently (comic sans, Times new roman), I will increase the number of fonts in the future.

Each letter of the title text should be one of the following colours chosen at random on page load:
#41BEDB
#EB7DDA
#FFAFDB
#FFFF63
#E2E2E2

You should not have any letters next to each other of the same colour.

Behind this text there should be a duplicate set of title text in black shifted slightly down and to the right to represent a drop shadow.
